# Hybrid Recommender Systems Training Framework

This repository contains the code to my research on recommender systems at Mercateo (<http://www.mercateo.com/>)

It is work in progress, so you may still expect major changes as well as refacturing.

To initialize place ML100k (ML1M) in data/ml-100k/ (data/ml-1m) and run scripts/data_prep_ml-100k.py (data_prep_ml-1m.py)
All executable python entry points to run the model are locates in scripts/.
